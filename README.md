# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition
This is an interesting Machine Learning project involving K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm

It recognises handwritten digits written in a 28 X 28 box on the basis of the standard MNIST handwritten digits database .
K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm is analogous to distance formula. Root squared difference between training and testing data set is used to
sort out the nearest matching K data points to the test point. Out of these neighbours, a majority vote count is taken to assign the class
to test point.

This project has limitations in recognising the digit such as the size of the image and the fact that it can recognise only one digit. 
Suggestions are welcome to improve the project and its utility.
